# pointToPointProgressBar
Simple view that could be used as some kind of a progress bar with states, here called points.

Points number, size, and bar size are configurable from xml. Also are colors. Not too many options, but sometimes less means more. If you need it, copy it into your app, if not, don't. 

You don't have to build it to see how it looks like because there is this gif:
